The literature explores several categories of conveyors and conveyor belts such as gravity, slat, pneumatic/vacuum, roller, overhead, screw, chain conveyors and their respective uses. The paper also encompasses the development of a belt conveyor system in accordance with the IS-11592 standard. This involves the utilization of 3D computer models and finite element analysis techniques to guarantee the longevity and effectiveness of the system in managing substantial loads such as coal.

This paper examines the challenges associated with conveyor belts including material adhesion, deterioration, and the implementation of maintenance solutions to address these concerns. Novel approaches such as dual scraper systems, brush systems, water spray, and rubber scrapers are proposed as efficacious methods for preserving the durability and dependability of conveyor belts.

It finishes by providing a contemplation on the pivotal significance of conveyor belts across diverse sectors and the persistent requirement for innovation and maintenance to ensure the optimal functioning of these systems. This research places significant emphasis on the integration of historical knowledge, contemporary technology, and future horizons in the advancement of conveyor belt systems, therefore highlighting their essential contribution to contemporary industrial processes.
